                        Top Pot Donuts Donut Generator 
                        -------------------------------

This page produces a table that shows the amount of donuts sold per hour. 
This data is produced by a few methods:
-One to create the amount of customers by using a random number generator and
the minimum and maximum customers per hour.
-One that takes the amount of customers generated and multiplies it to the average 
donuts per hour.
-then it takes the information created and adds it to a table on the page.
